Every server have a unique ID, so it's possible to have a many channels with different topics to conversations.
The application is written with React, uses Cloud Firestore to storage data about servers, categories, channels and messages.
Redux stores a informations about logged user and chats.

I like to make clones of known pages/application to improve my programming skills.
That allow me to focus on technologies, features and solutions more than thinking about page layout.
